Open price (i.e. Name your price) products for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**Product Open Pricing for WooCommerce** plugin lets you create open price (i.e. "name your price" or "pay your price") products in WooCommerce.

For each product you can optionally set:

* **Default** (i.e. Suggested) price
* **Minimum** price
* **Maximum** price

In general settings you can also:

* Customize **frontend template**
* Enable/disable open price input on **shop and category pages**
* Set **input style** and pattern
* Enable/disable **quantity selector**
* Set **price step** on frontend
* Enable/disable **step ticker**
* Optionally **show the original price** (for reference)
* Customize **user messages**

It's important to note that the free version allows enabling open pricing for only one product at a time.

The [premium version](https://wpwham.com/products/product-open-pricing-name-your-price-for-woocommerce/ "Upgrade to Product Open Pricing for WooCommerce Pro") will allow setting open pricing on multiple (i.e. unlimited number) products without restrictions.

== Changelog ==

= 1.7.1 - 2023-07-13 =
* FIX: PHP 8.2 notices.

= 1.7.0 - 2021-09-30 =
* UPDATE: PHP 8 now officially supported.
* UPDATE: disable Payment Request Buttons on product page for open pricing products. An amount must be entered and added to cart first. (DETAILS: PRBs [e.g. Apple Pay / Google Pay / PayPal] don't always work well with open pricing products, since the price is not determined until after the user selects the amount.  In v1.6.0 we used a temporary price of $1 in the background, which would be updated later with the real user-entered amount.  However this caused problems with Apple Pay in certain [not all] situations, where the user could possibly still see that $1 amount on the initial Apple Pay screen. The correct amount would be charged at the end, but this was too confusing to customers.  We've concluded the only 100% reliable way to handle these cases is to make sure the open pricing product is fully added to cart BEFORE the payment process begins.)
